- The strategy pattern is essentially just using composition over inheritance.

- Classes can be represented as specific composition of algorithms (strategies) which we simply gave a particular name.

- There are 2 flavors of Observer pattern:
  - Context is provided in 'update' method (problem: all subscribers can be notified with unnecessary info);
  - Concrete observable implementation is injected into subscribers (problem: coupling to concrete implementations + more unnecessary info for subscribers).

- Decorator pattern:
  - Can help us avoid class explosion;
  - Should be used in case when overridden methods have substantial differences in their behavior.
  - We need to track logical coherence when creating decorators: 'is-a' relationship should be sensible.

- We PROBABLY may use inheritance ONLY if we hope to achieve the following 2 goals:
  - Code reuse from a base class;
  - Polymorphism.
  In the rest of situations we should definitely prefer using composition.
